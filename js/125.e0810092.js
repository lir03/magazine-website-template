Of all the New Year’s resolutions being made, going on a diet is almost always at the top of the list. Unfortunately, many fall by the wayside half-way through this resolution. Chalk it up to being tempted by luscious, mouth-watering foods or to pure laziness but people almost always fall off the wagon when it comes to dieting. Fad diets do not help either as they just increase the food cravings and bring back the weight with a vengeance. So how do we address this issue?

Simply put, you either stop eating carbs or lower your carbohydrate intake and eat more fats. How does this work?

However, if you lower your intake of carbohydrates and increase your intake of fat, your body will be induced into a state known as ketosis. Ketosis is a natural process in the body that happens when the food intake is low. Ketosis is initiated to help the body survive. During this state, the body produces ketones which are produced from the breakdown of fats from the liver.
