Many a poet has written about its wonders and many a writer have marveled at its beauty. It is both a joy and a complexity, entangling you in its web even before you know you have been snared. Many people have tried to understand the essence of it and have failed. Love is meant to be felt not understood.

An ergonomic keyboard is better than the flat ones as it will relax your hands and wrist, thus avoiding any carpal injury. <li data-v-7af60502>Communicate</li>  In any relationship, communication is important. What more in a long-distance relationship where communication is the core of the relationship? It is vital that you and your partner communicate regularly. If you are busy, schedule a time when you can talk even for just 30 minutes a day.
